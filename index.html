        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> Tim Berners-Lee is an English computer scientist. He is well known as the inventor of World Wide Web or www. He invented it in 1989 at CERN. Tim Bereners-Lee was born in June 8, 1955 at London United Kingdom. He's education was at The Queen's College, Emanuel School, The Open University, and Sheen Mount Primary School. He married Nancy Carlson(m. 1990-2011) and then Rosemary Leith(m.2014) Some awards he got are the MacArthur Fellowship Award and the Turing Award. His Children are Ben and Alice. Some famous quotes of his are <br> "You affect the world by what you browse."<br>Berners-Lee published the first web site, which described the project itself, on 20 December 1990; it was available to the Internet from the CERN network. The site provided an explanation of what the World Wide Web was, and how people could use a browser and set up a web server, as well as how to get started with your own website. In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The World Wide Web Consortium decided that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology, so that they easily could be adopted by anyone. </p>
